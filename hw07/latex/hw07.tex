\section{D-Separation}

You missed the Artificial Intelligence Exam! When you try to explain to your professor your excuses for 
missing the exam, he stops you.  He offers to give you a grade based on your performance of mapping
your excuses and determining the D-separation of the excuses and the events associated with them. 
You draw out the events as a Bayes net seen above.  You must now answer the following questions
about the net to see what your grade for the exam you missed!

\noindent 
Consider the following pairs of variables to answer the questions below:
\newline\newline
\centerline{(a) $GS$ and $OA$  ;  (b) $DA$ and $MA$  ;  (c) $LP$ and $FD$  ;  (d) $TC$ and $MA$  ;  (e) $BB$ and $ME$}

Given the stated evidence, list the variables that are independent or conditionally independent.

\begin{enumerate}

	\item (4 points) No information (even the evidence that you missed the exam).

	\item (4 points) $MA$ is observed.

	\item (4 points) $BB$ is observed.

	\item (4 points) $LP$ is observed.

	\item (4 points) $TC$ is observed.

	\item (4 points) $LP$  and $OA$ are observed.

	\item (4 points) $ME$ is observed.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Inference by Enumeration}

\begin{center}

\begin{enumerate}

\item What is the expression for $P(A,b,C, \sim d,E,f)$ given the structure
  of this Bayes' net and conditional probability tables?

\item Form the joint distribution  $P(A,b,C, \sim d,E,f)$ using factors.  Please give the
  details of your derivation.

\item Solve for the query $P(C | b, \sim d, f)$.

\end{enumerate}
